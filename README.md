# Welcome to the Ponderosa Pine Energy Analysis
This project explores the intricate relationship between latitude, minimum recorded temperature, and energy (AET) variability in the US Ponderosa Pine. <br/>
Through this statistical analysis, I aim to uncover the influences of these factors on the energy content of these trees. <br/>

# Project Goals
> Investigate the Relationship: Analyze how latitude and minimum recorded temperature influence the variability of energy (AET) in Ponderosa Pine trees.<br/>
> Develop Regression Models: Construct and interpret regression equations to quantify the relationships between these variables.<br/>
> Statistical Analysis: Utilize various statistical tools to derive meaningful insights from the data.<br/>

# Data Collection
Raw data for this project were gathered from:<br/>
Data Source - [Kaggle Datasets][https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/comprehensive-conifer-sampling-in-north-america?resource=download]<br/>
Study Details - [Perret and Sax, 2021][https://zenodo.org/records/5713338#.Y9Y3xtJBwUE]<br/>

# Regression Equations
Regression equations are powerful statistical tools used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable (in this case, energy or AET) and one or more independent variables (latitude and minimum recorded temperature).<br/>

# Interpretation
The coefficients in regression equations indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. <br/>
Positive coefficients suggest a direct relationship, while negative coefficients imply an inverse relationship. <br/>

# Analysis and Findings
By employing these regression models, I aim to derive insights into how the geographical and climatic factors influence the energy dynamics in Ponderosa Pine trees. <br/>
The Ponderosa Pine Energy Analysis project showcases the power of statistical analysis in understanding complex ecological interactions. <br/>
